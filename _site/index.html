<p>Data science is in the hot spot today because data analyses play a
fundamental role in scientific studies and business decisions. However,
it was estimated that about 80% of the effort in a data science project
has to be dedicated to data preparation <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. A data preparation task
that is common in different industry-driven and science-driven
application domains is data enrichment. Data enrichment is the task of
enriching one main dataset, which describes a phenomenon of interest
(usually by means of an initial set of variables), with information from
third-party data sources, which contain additional variables to feed an
analytical model. By using the enriched data, a data scientist can
analyze the phenomenon under observation using a larger number of
dimensions or train a predictive model using a richer set of features.</p>

<p>On the one hand, data enrichment for data science provides new
high-impact application scenarios for exploiting the vast amount of
information available in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, either as
direct source of additional information, or as a bridge for fetching
data from information sources outside the LOD. On the other hand, data
enrichment provides several challenges for semantic data integration
methodologies, revamping known problems under a different perspective,
e.g., taxonomy matching, and prompting genuinely new problems, e.g.,
interactive data reconciliation at scale.</p>

<p>This tutorial has three main learning objectives: (L1) to provide an
in-depth understanding of the role that semantics play in data
enrichment for data science; (L2) to review advantages and limitations
of tools for semantic enrichment available today and of research work
relevant to this specific task; (L3) to provide a practical dive into
the creation of semantic data enrichment transformations with
Grafterizer and ASIA, two integrated tools that support the interactive
specification of these transformations and their scalable execution on
large datasets, as well as into the usage of the enriched data to train
predictive models with the QMiner tool.</p>

<p>In relation to L1, we will use examples and use cases from data science
projects developed in two industry-driven H2020 innovation projects,
EW-Shopp (<a href="www.ew-shopp.eu">www.ew-shopp.eu</a>) and euBusinessGraph
(<a href="www.eubusinessgraph.eu">www.eubusinessgraph.eu</a>), which target the
development of data-driven innovative services in domains such as
digital marketing, eCommerce, and business reporting. In relation to L2,
we will discuss the limitations of the approaches based on ad-hoc coding
and other semantic agnostic data transformation technologies to deliver
data-scientist-friendly solutions. In addition we will discuss research
work and prototypes developed in the semantic web, which addressed
<em>some</em> of the challenges that a data-scientist-friendly solution should
solve, and their current limitations (e.g., scalability, support for
interaction, etc.). In relation to L3, we will provide an hands-on
session to enrich (anonimized) data from a digital marketing agency,
which wants to estimate the impact of weather on the impressions of the
ads it manages in its campaigns. We will show how to enrich the source
datasets with spatial coordinates extracted from Geonames, our
"bridge", to eventually fetch data from a weather API. Finally, we
will show how to use the enriched data to train a predictive model to
estimate the impact of weather on the performance campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Length and draft schedule.</strong> The tutorial will be a half-day tutorial,
requiring approximately three hours including presentations and a
hands-on section. The draft schedule proposed for the tutorial is the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data enrichment for data science.</strong> Topics: challenges; semantics
technologies as key enablers; analytics with enriched data: use
cases from industry-driven data science projects. <em>Duration: approx.
45 minutes</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>State-of-the-art: semantic data enrichment for data science.</strong>
Topics: semantic table annotation tools and techniques; doing it
with OpenRefine: lessons learned and limitations; data enrichment
with batch pipelines: lessons learned and limitations; user-driven
data enrichment at scale: the Grafterizer/ASIA approach; QMiner and
data analytics on top of enriched data. <em>Duration: approx. 45
minutes</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A toolkit for user-driven data enrichment at scale endowed with
robust analytical modeling.</strong> Topics: the Grafterizer/ASIA data
transformation tool: cleaning, annotating and enriching data;
QMiner: data analytics on top of enriched data. Approx. 30 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hands-on session: digital marketing data enrichment with weather
data and analytical modelling.</strong> Environment set up; design of the
data transformation workflows with Grafterizer/ASIA; batch execution
of the transformations on a larger data set; training the predictive
model with QMiner; deployment of the predictive model. <em>Duration:
approx. 60 minutes</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prior art.</strong> The tutorial is presented for the first time. No overlap
with previous tutorials exists.</p>

<h1 id="target-audience">Target audience</h1>

<p>We expect to attract as audience three different profiles of
stakeholders: i) researchers that have expertise in semantic
technologies, and, in particular in their application to data
integration problems (e.g., ontology matching, semantic reconciliation,
table annotation), who will discover new industry-driven, real-world
application scenarios for their research results; ii) researchers that
have recently entered into the semantic web community, e.g., PhD
students and postdocs, who will learn not only about new application
scenarios, but also about challenging problems whose solution may have
significant impact both in the industry as well as in other science
fields, where analyses on top of semantically enriched data may be bring
added value; iii) practitioners and workers in the industry field, who
will learn about concrete use case for using semantic technology to
support data-driven innovation at scale.</p>

<p>To engage audience at the conference we will announce the tutorial
through several channels using accounts from our research institutions
and from the euBusinessGraph and EW-Shopp innovation projects. In
addition to that, we will get endorsements from the projects’ business
partners and their communication channels. The material will be
published online to foster attention by those who could not attend the
tutorial, with particular reference to practitioners and industry
employees.</p>
